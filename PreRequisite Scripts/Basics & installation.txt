1. Install all pre requisite packages for hyperledger Composer.

2. Install YeoMan through npm.

3. Install Composer-cli using npm command npm i -g composer-cli, if you encounter permission error then use this command npm i -g --unsafe-perm composer-cli.

4. Using Same method install composer-rest-server as mentioned in step 3.

5. Install generator-hyperledger-composer, as mentioned in step3. Check the status of installation using yo --generators command.

6. Install a HyperLedger Composer Extenstion in VScode.
   (Composer Language is used for generating models for Business Applications).

7. Intsall composer-playground via Npm.

8. Install Hyperledger Fabric
	
	In a directory of your choice (we will assume ~/fabric-dev-servers), get the .tar.gz file that contains the tools to install Hyperledger Fabric:
   ~ 	mkdir ~/fabric-dev-servers && cd ~/fabric-dev-servers

	curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/composer-tools/master/packages/fabric-dev-servers/fabric-dev-servers.tar.gz
	tar -xvf fabric-dev-servers.tar.gz



	Use the scripts you just downloaded and extracted to download a local Hyperledger Fabric v1.2 runtime:
   ~ 	cd ~/fabric-dev-servers
	export FABRIC_VERSION=hlfv12
	./downloadFabric.sh


   	Above Commands will pull the 5-6 docker Images and you can check it by tpying docker images , it will list the downloaded docker images.

9. How to generate models and business network application.

	Yeoman code Generators -:
		
	1. Model - Business Model 
	2. Network Application - A sample modifiable model file for creating own domain model and also includes sample transaction processor also
	   Includes testcases.
	3. Web Application (Skeleton)- For builting the front-end.

	Commands-:

	yo hypeledger-composer -: Type it to generate the code.
	
	1.Select type of network and fill the subsequent details.
 
		* Model- For generating business model.
		
		* Business Network- For generating network application. Lib folder contain a file logic.js. It has a skeleton code to write transactions in
				    Js. Similarly test folder also contain a logic.js that is used for unit testing using mocha and chai.


** User can take multiple roles in a Business Network Application -:

   Peer Administrator    - Administrates the node and can create multiple network administrator.
   Network Administrator - Administrates the network application and can create multiple user and assigns them rule.


** To connect to a network and carrying out activities at business network User must have appropriate roles, credentials and connection profile. 

** Apilcation and tools requires the identity of user and connection information ( both of configuration file stored in CARDS).

** For a application to connect to a network, the application must have access Business Network Cards. Cards have credientials, keys and certificates and
   connection profile.  

** Structure of Card - :

	             	
		* Crypto | Credentials.
		
		* Composer Connection Profile-:
				
				* It contains the information about how reach MSP | CA.
				* It contains the information about how to reach to Composer Runtime (Peers and Orderers). Information contain URL for each of
				  this components.
							
	

** Cards are stored and managed on file system. ./Composer folder contains two sub-folders i.r cards and client-data (Stores Key files and certificates).
 
   
** Directory Structure of Cards:

   /home/${user}/.composer/cards

   Cards folder contain the number of cards folder. Name of a Card folder is like xxx@yyy.
   
	Here,xxx signifies identity of user and yyy signifies identity of application/node.

   Card folder contain 2 files and a sub-folder -:

   	connection.json      - It have data about name, type, orderers, ca, peers, channel, mspID, timeout.
	metadata.json	     - It have data about version, username and multiple roles users have.
  	credentials (Folder) - It contains private key certificate.


    Cards are managed by Composer-CLI.
    
    Composer CLI can be used for fetching list about cards, type composer card --help.

    You can list create delete card.	  Ex- composer card create
		
    You can also import and export card.  Ex- composer card export -n ${card to be exported} -f ${file to the card is to be exported}.
  
10. Archiving the Business Model.
	
    * Go into project folder, create a folder dist and go into dist and then run the following command.

	Command -: composer archive create -t dir -n ../ 

    ALT: Creating from source folder, make a folder dist and then run the following command. 
	
	Command -: composer archive create -a dist/airlinev3.bna --sourceType d


11. Deploying a BNA to Hyperledger network (Local)

   * Launch your fabric Network (Using shell scripts).
   
   * Verify | Create the Peer Admin Card (Using shell scripts).

   * Install the network application archive to fabric.

	Command - composer network install -a ${archive file} -c {card}

   * Start command on composer cli to start BNA. When this command is executed successfully a new network card will be generated and will be
     available on local file system. Network card needs to be depolyed by network administrator on their machine so that they can carry
     out administrative action on business network

	Command - composer network start -c PeerAdmin@hlfv1 -n test-bna -V 0.0.1 -A admin -S adminpw
	
		 	-c Card used to start the network.
			-n Name of the network insalled previously by through archive file.	
			-V version of the network.
			-A Name of network administrator (Username)
			-S A secret (password).

   * After starting network, a network administrator's card will be created.
	
	To Import the card use
		
		Command - composer card import -f ${name}.


   * Checking status and pinging the network.
     Network Administrator card is required to be deployed/imported.
	
	Commands-
		composer network ping -c{cardName} - Use to check the availability of network application.
 		composer network list -c{cardName} - Use to check the details of network application. Lists regiesteries about network application.



12. Chaincode of the application can be upgraded. Stpes to upgrade chaincode-:

	* Create Archive for the new version of BNA.
	
	* Install the new version of archive.

	* List the network application and use command- 
		
		composer network upgrade -c ${PeerAdminCard} -n ${name of archive file} -V ${version}

    Pre-requisites to upgrade -: You have to change the version in the json file before archiving and installing.
