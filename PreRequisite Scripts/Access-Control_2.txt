Best Practice for defining access control:

   Exposing CRUD operations for resuouce by the way of Transactions.
   
   Above approach will insure that-:
	
	* Business logic cannot be by-passed.
	* Data stays consistent.
	* Prevents unauthorized changes. 

** Transaction-:

   We have to provide specification of the transaction in the rule.

	Conditions expression are used to validate the access based on the condition it has been imposed.
	
 		Condition elements can access various elements in the exectuion context by the way of Symbolic Access. You can associate symbols with
		elements in the rule. 
	
			Ex-:
				participant(p)	: "org.example.SampleParticipant"
				resource(r)	: "org.example.SampleAsset"
				condition	: (r.owner.getIndetifier()==p.getIdentifier())

	
	Complex Conditions are also supported. We can create a utility function in a script file.

			Ex-:
				participant(p)	: "org.example.SampleParticipant"
				resource(r)	: "org.example.SampleAsset"
				condition	: (evaluateAccess(r,p))
