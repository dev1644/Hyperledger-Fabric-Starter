 
*  In order to a mid-tier application to take action on fabric-network or any BNA, the application needs to connect to Fabric Runetime.

*  Using two classes , we can make a connection to fabric network.

	1. Admin Connection.

	2. Business Network Connection Class.


1. Admin Connection -:

	AdminConnection class is available under the admin module. An application can create instance of this class to  -:

		* Take Administrative actions on Fabric Runtime.
		* Administrative actions on Business Network Application.
		
	BusinessNetworkConnection class is used to Execute transaction, CRUD Operations, Receive events on BNA. 
	This class is avialble under client module.


	Both the classes are required to call connect function with the Card Name.

	
	AdminConnection class's instance is created by using "New" operator, constructor needs a JSON object that provides
	"Wallet type". 
	
	After creating the instance , we can connect using connect("cardName") and disconnect using disconnect().

		Two types of connection functions will be available -:

			* Card Related Functions:

				getAllCards   hasCard   deleteCard   importCard   exportCard
	
			* BNA Management Functions:

				install   start   list   ping   reset   upgrade


	To install a archive in Fabric Runtime, we can use install fucntion:

		install() functions needs an instance of BusinessNetworkDefinition
		
			Ex:
			    Install(BusinessNetworkDefiniton, ...)
			    start(..)

			    To Upgrade:
			   	 Install(BusinessNetworkDefiniton, ...)
			    	 upgrade(Version, ...).




	* BusnessNetworkDefintion Class is available unser Common module. It represents the BNA, It encapsulates the
	  Meta-Data , Domain specific resource model, Scripts.

	  To create instance of BusnessNetworkDefintion there are two ways-:
		
		1. fromArchive()  , It reads BNA archive file to create the instance of BNA
		2. fromDirectory(), It reads the model from content Directory.
